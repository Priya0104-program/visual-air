User will have to register their information first like name and location.

In this work, we used Java language, the Android Studio platform, Android ADT, and the Android SDK to develop the Visual-air android application. 
The Visual-air  application uses the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and standard websites to give air quality data. If the pollution rate is huge, it alerts a notification message.
The sensor readings from Arduino IDE are uploaded to cloud service framework - Ubidots. It provides user friendly protocols to store and access the data.
 The real time air quality percentage and levels are continuously updated in the Ubidots portal. 
The uploaded data can be visualized as per user perception in the form of ranges and charts.
